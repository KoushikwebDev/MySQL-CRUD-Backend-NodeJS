## Core Difference: SQL vs MySQL

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and interacting with relational databases. You use SQL to query, update, and manipulate data stored in a database. It is not a tool or software—it’s the language.[^1_1][^1_5][^1_6]
- **MySQL** is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its query language. MySQL provides the actual environment and technology to store, organize, and manage data within tables using SQL commands. MySQL is just one possible implementation; other RDBMSs like Oracle, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server also use SQL as their query language.[^1_3][^1_5][^1_6]

### Key Differences Table

| SQL | MySQL |
| :-- | :-- |
| A query language | A database management system (software) |
| Used to interact with data in RDBMS | Used to create, store, and manage databases using SQL |
| Doesn't change often | Receives regular updates |
| No built-in connectors | Has tools like MySQL Workbench |
| Not software or open-source | Open-source (with commercial options) |
| Used with any relational DB | Specific to MySQL technology |

### Simple Analogy

- *SQL is like the language you use to talk to a bank teller.*
- *MySQL is the bank itself, storing your money (data), and you interact with it via SQL (the teller).*[^1_3]

***

### Usage Scenarios

- If you are **writing queries** to retrieve or manipulate database records, you use SQL.
- If you are **running a platform**, such as a website or an app, and you choose to use MySQL to store your data, you are using MySQL and you will write your queries in SQL.

***

### Summary

- **SQL**: Standard query language for relational databases.
- **MySQL**: Software system that uses SQL to manage and store data, one of many RDBMS options.[^1_5][^1_1][^1_3]

This means that SQL is the language, and MySQL is a database system that understands and executes commands written in SQL.
